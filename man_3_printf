.SH NAME
.B _printf
- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function writes output to
.I stdout
produced according to
.I formats
as described below.

.B Return value
.br
.RS 3
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.RE
.B The conversion specifier
.br
.RS 3
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The
conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B d, i
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The
precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is
padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1. When
0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output it empty.
.LP
.TP
.B o, u
The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is converted to unsigned octal (\fBo\fR),
or unsigned decimal (\fBu\fR).
.LP
.TP
.B c
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fR, and the
resulting character is written.
.LP
.TP
.B s
The \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array
of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are
written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
.LP
.TP
.B r
The \fIchar *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of
character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are then
reversed and returned.
.LP
.TP
.B R
The \fIchar *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of
character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are then
converted and rotated 13 characters forward in the alphabet.

.B The conversion specifiers

.IP %c
- prints character.
.IP %s
- prints string.
.IP %%
